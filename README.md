Project Description/
"FindMyPhysio" is meant to make it easier to find physiotherapy services. Because "FindMy Physio" knows how hard it can be for people to find specialised healthcare providers, it focuses on being quick and easy to use. The platform's main features are an easy-to-use search function, filters that can be changed (like region, specialty, etc.), and user profiles for both patients and physiotherapists, which make the experience smooth and helpful.

Tools and Methods for Development

The website was built with CSS and JavaScript, and React made it easier to make dynamic user experiences. Password hashing protects user data during the registration process so that the experience is safe and easy to use. The website also works perfectly on all devices and web platforms thanks to its responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.

API Integration: Enhancing User Experience

While I wasn't able to fully implement maps and reviews integration due to technical complexities, I recognize the value these features bring. A maps API would provide accurate location services, interactive maps, and geolocation, significantly enhancing user convenience. Similarly, integrating a review API (e.g., Yelp) would empower users with authentic feedback about physiotherapy services, building trust within the platform.

Prioritizing Privacy and Data Protection

User privacy is a core concern in 'FindMy Physio's' design. A transparent privacy policy outlines how user data is handled. User consent is paramount, and I would obtain explicit permission before collecting personal information or accessing geolocation data, if those features were implemented.

The Value of User-Centered Research

A user-centered approach profoundly shaped the development of 'FindMy Physio'. Personas, questionnaires, and wireframing were some of the techniques that were used to get direct information about the wants and needs of possible users. The main results of this study showed how important it is to have specialised search, clear information presentation, and easy access. Because of this, these factors became guiding principles in the design and growth of the platform's features.

Problem, Audience, and Key Features

"FindMy Physio" solves the common problem of how hard it is to find trainers who meet your needs. The target audience is anyone seeking physiotherapy services. Some important features are:

Advanced Search: Users can easily find physiotherapists by region, specialisation, and other factors that are important to them.
API Demo: It wasn't possible to fully integrate Google Maps, but I've included a demo API that shows a list of potential physiotherapists based on where the user enters.
Sign up and log in pages: Allowing Physiotherapists sign up with their practices//services for direct contact with users.

Problems and Lessons Learned

Even though the project was successful, I ran into problems along the way. It turned out to be harder than expected to combine the maps and reviews APIs, so more study and testing were needed. To help with this in some ways, I added a test API that shows how these features can be used. I learned how important it is to be flexible in development and how useful iterative design is—even a simple implementation can show how it works and get feedback for future changes.
